ABSTRACT = {Seismic lines are narrow, linear corridors cleared through forests for oil and gas exploration. Their inconsistent recovery has led to Alberta’s forests being highly fragmented, resulting in the need for seismic line restoration programs and subsequent monitoring. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is becoming an increasingly popular technology for the fast and accurate measurement of forests. Mobile LiDAR scanners (MLS) are emerging as an alternative to traditional aerial LiDAR due to their increased point cloud density. To determine whether MLS could be effective for collecting vegetation data on seismic lines, we sampled 17 seismic lines using the Emesent Hovermap™ in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. Processing the LiDAR data was conducted with GreenValley International’s LiDAR 360 software, and data derived from the point clouds were compared to physically measured field data. Overall, the tree detection algorithm was unsuccessful at accurately segmenting the point clouds. Complex vegetation environments on seismic lines, including small conifers with obscured stems or extremely dense and tall shrubs with overlapping canopies, posed a challenge for the software’s capacity to differentiate trees As a result, tree densities and diameters were overestimated, while tree heights were underestimated. Exploration of alternative algorithms and software is needed if measuring vegetation data on seismic lines with MLS is to be implemented.},

abstract = {Damage mapping is considered a critical stage in the correct diagnosis of the state of conservation of Cultural Heritage manifestations. The common approach generally implies a large user interaction to map the different pathological processes presented on 2D documents such as elevations or sections, among others. In contrast with this practice, the present paper proposes a semiautomatic 3D-methodology, with a minimum user interaction, able to accurately analyse both radiometric and geometric data recovered by a non-contact technology (Terrestrial Laser Scanning), allowing the extraction and quantification of a wide diversity of pathological processes from biological colonization to deformations. This approach is therefore a potential tool for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of Cultural Heritage. To confirm the applicability and potential offered by the proposed methodology, a highly affected historical masonry, the San Francisco Master Gate of the Almeida Fortress (Portugal), was evaluated by using the Faro Focus 3D 120 Laser Scanner.}

abstract = {A rigorous method for terrestrial laser scanner self-calibration using a network of signalised points is presented. Exterior orientation, object point co-ordinates and additional parameters are estimated simultaneously by free network adjustment. Spherical co-ordinate observation equations are augmented with a set of additional parameters that model systematic errors in range, horizontal direction and elevation angle. The error models include both physically interpretable and empirically identified components. Though the focus is on one particular make and model of AM–CW scanner system, the Faro 880, the mathematical models are formulated in a general framework so their application to other instruments only requires selection of an appropriate set of additional parameters. Results from controlled testing show that significant improvement is achieved by using the proposed model in terms of both reducing the magnitude of observational residuals as well as the three-dimensional positioning accuracy of signalised points. Ten self-calibration datasets captured over the course of 13 months are used to examine short- and long-term additional parameter stability via standard hypothesis testing techniques. Detailed investigations into correlation mechanisms between model parameters accompany the self-calibration solution analyses. Other contributions include an observation model for incorporation of integrated inclinometer observations into the self-calibration solution and an effective a priori outlier removal method. The benefit of the former is demonstrated to be reduced correlation between exterior orientation and additional parameters, even if inclinometer precision is low. The latter is arrived at by detailed analysis of the influence of incidence angle on range.}

ABSTRACT = {Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has been successfully used for three-dimensional (3D) data capture in forests for almost two decades. Beyond the plot-based data capturing capabilities of TLS, vehicle-based mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems have the clear advantage of fast and precise corridor-like 3D data capture, thus providing a much larger coverage within shorter acquisition time. This paper compares and discusses advantages and disadvantages of multi-temporal MLS data acquisition compared to established TLS data recording schemes. In this pilot study on integrated TLS and MLS data processing in a forest, it could be shown that existing TLS data evaluation routines can be used for MLS data processing. Methods of automatic laser scanner data processing for forest inventory parameter determination and quantitative structure model (QSM) generation were tested in two sample plots using data from both scanning methods and from different seasons. TLS in a multi-scan configuration delivers very high-density 3D point clouds, which form a valuable basis for generating high-quality QSMs. The pilot study shows that MLS is able to provide high-quality data for an equivalent determination of relevant forest inventory parameters compared to TLS. Parameters such as tree position, diameter at breast height (DBH) or tree height can be determined from MLS data with an accuracy similar to the accuracy of the parameter derived from TLS data. Results for instance in DBH determination by cylinder fitting yielded a standard deviation of 1.1 cm for trees in TLS data and 3.7 cm in MLS data. However, the resolution of MLS scans was found insufficient for successful QSM generation. The registration of MLS data in forests furthermore requires additional effort in considering effects caused by poor GNSS signal.},

abstract = {The development of reliable fruit detection and localization systems provides an opportunity to improve the crop value and management by limiting fruit spoilage and optimised harvesting practices. Most proposed systems for fruit detection are based on RGB cameras and thus are affected by intrinsic constraints, such as variable lighting conditions. This work presents a new technique that uses a mobile terrestrial laser scanner (MTLS) to detect and localise Fuji apples. An experimental test focused on Fuji apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. Fuji) was carried out. A 3D point cloud of the scene was generated using an MTLS composed of a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor synchronised with an RTK-GNSS satellite navigation receiver. A reflectance analysis of tree elements was performed, obtaining mean apparent reflectance values of 28.9%, 29.1%, and 44.3% for leaves, branches and trunks, and apples, respectively. These results suggest that the apparent reflectance parameter (at 905 nm wavelength) can be useful to detect apples. For that purpose, a four-step fruit detection algorithm was developed. By applying this algorithm, a localization success of 87.5%, an identification success of 82.4%, and an F1-score of 0.858 were obtained in relation to the total amount of fruits. These detection rates are similar to those obtained by RGB-based systems, but with the additional advantages of providing direct 3D fruit location information, which is not affected by sunlight variations. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that LiDAR-based technology and, particularly, its reflectance information, has potential for remote apple detection and 3D location.}

ABSTRACT = {Mobile LiDAR System is an emerging technology that combines multiple sensors. Active sensors, together with Inertial and Global Navigation System, are synchronized on a mobile platform to produce an accurate and precise geospatial 3D point cloud. They allow obtaining a large amount of georeferenced 3D information in a fast and efficient way, which can be used in several applications such as the 3D recording and reconstruction of complex urban areas and/or landscapes. In this study the Mobile LiDAR System is applied in the field of Cultural Heritage aiming to evaluate its performance with the purpose to document, divulgate, or to develop an architectural analysis. This study was focused on the Medieval Wall of Avila (Spain) and, specifically, the performed accuracy tests were applied in the “Alcazar” gate (National Monument from 1884). The Mobile LiDAR System is then compared to the most commonly employed active sensors (Terrestrial Laser Scanner) for large Cultural Heritage sites in regard to time, accuracy and resolution of the point cloud. The discrepancies between both technologies are established comparing directly the 3D point clouds generated, highlighting the errors affecting the architectural structures. Consequently, and based on a detailed geometrical analysis, an optimization methodology is proposed, establishing a segmented and classified cluster for the structures. Furthermore, three main clusters are settled, according to the curvature: (i) planar or low curvature; (ii) cylindrical, mild transitions and medium curvature; and (iii) the abrupt transitions of high curvature. The obtained 3D point clouds in each cluster are analyzed and optimized, considering the reference spatial sampling, according to a confidence interval and the feature curvature. The presented results suggest that Mobile LiDAR System is an optimal approach, allowing a high-speed data acquisition and providing an adequate accuracy for large Cultural Heritage sites.},
